# Frogger - Arcade Game Project
This was a project that I developed as part of my Udacity [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The project required me to build my own version of the classic arcade game 'Frogger', using Object Oriented Javascript. Udacity provided some initial javascript for rendering the game canvas. I wrote the javascript to bring the game's functionality to life, as well as customizing the HTML and CSS.

## What I Learned
This project gave me an opportunity to practice what I learned in the Exploring JS - Objects, Tools and Testing section of my course.

Specifically I practiced:
* using Object Oriented Javascript

## Getting Started
You can try the Arcade Game out here:
https://srykov.github.io/fend-arcade-game/

Alternatively you can try the game out by doing the following:
* Download the source code
* Open index.html in your browser.
* Start playing by choosing a character!

## How The Game Works
The object of the game is to reach the water, without touching any bugs!  You can move your character by pressing the up, down, left and right arrow keys. You get one point for reaching the water and one point for each treasures you collect as you go. You win the game when you have collected 4 points.
